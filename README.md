Mini-Project 4: Associative Arrays
==================================
https://github.com/tyu012/mp4-associative-arrays

## Changelog
* Before submission of MP5 (3/12):
  * implemented `clone` method in `AssociativeArray`
* First resubmission of MP4 (4/13):
  * changed `key.equals(null)` to `key == null` since a null pointer does not
    have a `equals` method.
  * submitted all files instead of just `AssociativeArray.java` and readme.
